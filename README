Crimson Pyramid is a project of the Red Triangle Technology Collective.
This repository contains the server agents.  The backup system and web management system components are stored in separate repositories also on github.

sqlagent = the MySQL database creation/destruction agent (runs on mysql servers)
dnsagent = the DNS server agent which maintains zonefiles (runs on dns servers)
unixagent = the agent which creates unix user accounts (runs on all Linux/UNIX servers)
webagent = the Apache virtual host maintenance agent (runs on web servers)

Any number of these agents can run on any server.  You can even run all of the agents and the web interface on a single server if that's all you have.
